## Overview

**TapMenu** is a landing page and web app that offers restaurants a system of **NFC** cards (with QR code backup) to access their menus instantly and contactlessly.
The application features *Starter*, *SME*, and *Premium* plans, integrates a **contact form** that generates a pre-filled message to WhatsApp, and is built on the Jamstack (Next.js + Firebase) stack.
